This sample displays a rotating rectangle. It shows you how to use vertex buffers and shaders with a transformation matrix. The shaders were compiled with `FXC.exe`, the DirectX effects compiler, which is included in the DirectX SDK and the Windows Platform SDK. The compiled shader object code was then converted to a Go byte array to be used directly in the code.

For window creation this sample uses [SDL2](https://github.com/veandco/go-sdl2). Direct3D needs a handle to the window it runs in so you need a method for setting this up. Other libraries that you can use include [Allen Dang's w32 library](https://github.com/AllenDang/w32) and the [walk library](https://github.com/lxn/walk).

If you simply build this sample with `go build` the resulting program will keep a console window open while running. Use the `build.bat` to build instead, it passes the flag `-H=windowsgui` to the linker which gets rid of the console window.
