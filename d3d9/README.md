# Update
This package is the old CGo version of [github.com/gonutz/d3d9](https://github.com/gonutz/d3d9). It is a copy of release version 1.0.0 which is now replaced with a pure Go version 2 of the library. There are some incompatibilities between these versions so this package here is for people who were using version 1 and who do not want to update their code base in all the places that are broken now. The only thing to change for you if you have this problem is to point your imports that are now `github.com/gonutz/d3d9` to `github.com/gonutz/cgo/d3d9` instead.

# d3d9
This library is a Go wrapper for Microsoft's Direct3D9 API.

# Build
Besides a working Go installation you need to have a C compiler installed. The library was tested with [MinGW (32 bit)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/) on Windows XP and with MinGW (64 bit) on Windows 8.1. No additional Go or C libraries are needed to build, once you have set up your C compiler just use

    go get -u github.com/gonutz/cgo/d3d9

to build and install.

To run a Direct3D9 application you need to have d3d9.dll installed on your system. Since Windows XP this is pre-installed with all Windows versions, so if you have Go installed you will have d3d9.dll as well. This also means that you will not need to ship any additional DLL when building with this library.

# Usage
All Direct3D9 interfaces are translated to Go types and their methods are translated to functions on the types so the usage is very close to the C++ API.

There are some differences in the names in Go, since the package is named `d3d9`, all names in that package drop the `D3D` and `9` parts because they would be redundant. The changes are:

- Interfaces drop the `IDirect3D` prefix and the `9` suffix, e.g. `IDirect3DDevice9` becomes `d3d9.Device`. The only exception is `IDirect3D9` which in Go becomes `Direct3D`.
- Constants and enumerations drop the `D3D` prefix, otherwise they are the same and keep the upper case convention so users of Direct3D can easily find what they are looking for. For example `D3DADAPTER_DEFAULT` becomes `d3d9.ADAPTER_DEFAULT`, `D3DFMT_R8G8B8` becomes `d3d9.FMT_R8G8B8` etc.
- Structs, like constants, only drop the `D3D` prefix, they too keep the upper case naming convention, so `D3DRANGE` becomes `d3d9.RANGE`. There is one exception to this, `D3DRECT` is still `d3d9.D3DRECT` because the API also uses Windows' `RECT` type so the name `d3d9.RECT` is used for that.
- Error constants also drop the `D3D` prefix so `D3DERR_OUTOFVIDEOMEMORY` becomes `ERR_OUTOFVIDEOMEMORY`. However, the interface functions do not return these constants, they return Go `error`s instead of `HRESULT`s.
- Instead of returning `HRESULT`, Direct3D9 functions return `d3d9.Error` which implements the standard Go error interface and has an additional function `Code() int` which returns the error code. This code can be checked against the defined error constants. If a function succeeds it returns `nil`.

Note that Direct3D9 needs a window handle for setting it up. This means that you need some way to create a native window and get the handle to pass it to d3d9. In the samples you can see how to do it using the [SDL2 Go wrapper](https://github.com/veandco/go-sdl2) and [Allen Dang's w32](https://github.com/AllenDang/w32). You could also use other Windows wrapper libraries, like the [walk library](https://github.com/lxn/walk), or just write a little CGo code to set up a window yourself. This library does not provide window creation or event handling functionality, only the Direct3D9 wrapper.

When you write a program using this library, make sure to add this code in your main package:

    func init() {
	    runtime.LockOSThread()
	}

There are some additional convenience functions. `IndexBuffer` and `VertexBuffer` have `Lock` functions which return void* pointers in the C API and would thus return unsafe.Pointers in Go. You can use these pointers to read and write various types from/to that memory. However, using unsafe.Pointer is not idiomatic Go so the `Lock` functions return a wrapper around the unsafe.Pointer instead. The wrapper provides functions of the form `GetFloat32s` and `SetFloat32s` which take a slice of `[]float32` and handles copying the data for you. See the functions for the documentation.

Similarly, when locking a two-dimensional resource, like a texture, you will get a `d3d9.LOCKED_RECT`. It too has a wrapper function for setting its 2D data. There is however no function to read the data, yet, and no functions for reading and writing sub-rectangles which could be useful. These functions can be added when needed by a real application to see the use case first and implement the functions according to that instead of guessing what might work. If you need such a function, create a pull request or an issue and it can be incorporated in this library.

# Documentation
See the [GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/gonutz/cgo/d3d9) for the Go API. The functions are only documented very generally, to get more detailed information about the Direct3D9 API see the [MSDN documentation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb172964%28v=vs.85%29.aspx).

# Examples
The samples folder contains some example programs that show the basics of setting up and using the library.

One real world usage of this library is [my entry](https://github.com/gonutz/gophette) to the [GopherGala 2016](http://gophergala.com/). It was first built using SDL2 and after the competition I ported it to DirectX, see [`main_windows.go`](https://github.com/gonutz/gophette/blob/master/main_windows.go) for the implementation.

# Status
The code started out as a rough version generated from the MSDN online documentation and was then manually refined to work well with Go and its conventions. It wraps the whole Direct3D9 API right now and adds some additional convenience functions for easy Go usage. However, LOCKED_RECT only has one function for setting the whole data rectangle at once, there is no simple way to set only sub-rectangles right now. Similarly the CubeTexture's LOCKED_BOX has no wrapper functions for getting and setting its data, yet. For now the raw unsafe.Pointer memory pointers can be used along with the pitch values and in the future such functions can be added when needed.
